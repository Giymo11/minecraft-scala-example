# Welcome to Minecrafterooni!

## About

This is a small Minecraft Mod, aimed at learning the forge/FML framework and how to work with it using **Scala**.

I followed mainly these resources:
* [How to make a Minecraft mod](https://gist.github.com/nornagon/f9ae87c01740db0518b7) by nornagon (in Scala)
* The deobfuscated Minecraft Source Code!
* [Minecraft Modding Knowledge Base](http://modwiki.temporal-reality.com/mw/index.php/Main_Page)
* [Minecraft by Example](https://github.com/TheGreyGhost/MinecraftByExample) by TheGreyGhost
* [Minecraft Forge Documentation](https://mcforge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [Modding Tutorials](http://bedrockminer.jimdo.com/modding-tutorials/) by \_Bedrock\_Miner\_

These sound good, but I have not yet investigated further:
* [Modder Support Forum](http://www.minecraftforge.net/forum/index.php/board,73.0.html)
* IRC #MinecraftForge on esper.net
* [Minecraft 1.9 Modding Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy11IosblXIH-OIKa5yYs-KEA2LCohV8g) on Youtube by MrCrayfish

Thanks a lot to [bdew](https://github.com/bdew) for pointing most of this stuff out to me!

## Installation

* `git clone` this repository
* Run `gradlew setupDecompWorkspace` to let gradle do its thing
* Make a new IntelliJ project from these existing sources (I used Gradle as model)
* Change stuff and use `gradlew runClient` or `gradlew runServer` to try stuff!
